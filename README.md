# Implementing a Deep Neural Network from scratch

Gilles Deknache Febuary 2024

This project has been assigned by Prof. Michal Madden as an assigment for the Deep Learning module at University of Galway. It consist of 5 part :

- Part 1 : Implementation of logistic regression which is the fundation of a neural network
- Part 2 : Testing a Blob and Circle dataset
- Part 3 : Implementation of a shallow neural network which is a neural network with only one layer
- Part 4 : Testing Fashion-MNIST data set, only selecting two classes
- Part 5 : Implement deep neural network which support any given structure and provide one further enhancement
    - I chose to Implement a multi-class classifier, adding the softmax function for the last layer
- Part 6 : testing on fashion-MNIST dataset for the 9 classes (I added this part)
